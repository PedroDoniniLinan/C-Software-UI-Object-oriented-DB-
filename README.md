# C-Software-UI-Object-oriented-DB-
University project of a report system using MVC design pattern with C++/SQL.

This project cannot be run since there's no connection to the database used during the development.

All source code for the entities and interface screens are inside the folder Mantenikola>Mantenikola.

* It is possible to run the visual Studio project and see the first two screens, but any other action 
besides that crashes the program, since there is no connection to the dataabse.
