# C-Software-UI-Object-oriented-DB-
University project of a report system using MVC design pattern with C++/SQL.

This program's funciton consists of inputing data that would be added to a database afterwards having the possibility to 
generate reports of data registered.

This project cannot be run since there's no connection to the database used during the development.Even so, 
all source code for the entities and interface screens are inside the folder Mantenikola>Mantenikola.

* It is possible to run the visual Studio project and see the first two screens, but any other action 
besides that crashes the program, since there is no connection to the dataabse.
